Eric is a PhD student in the Social and Personality Psychology program under the supervision of Dr. Amy Muise. His previous research has explored an online speed dating paradigm and the role of personal and relational self-expansion in couples that have recently relocated. More recently, he has explored the role of trait charisma in the maintenance of sexual and relationship quality in established relationships.

Broadly, Ericâ€™s research interests include processes involved in the initiation of romantic relationships and ways in which couples can maintain their relationship and sexual satisfaction over time. Aside from research, Eric enjoys bouldering, boardgames, cycling, volleyball, and hiking.
